## Welcome to My Page!

Here you can view a few of my details including links to various projects I'm working on currently (or will be in the near future).

## About Me

I'm an IT pro who's been doing a lot of consulting work recently, but I'm getting back to GitHub with a fresh account _(my first account was REALLY old)_ and a fresh start to dive back into coding in earnest while I'm studying for a few different certification exams. As you can probably tell, I don't really like downtime much so I tend to be busy with self-improvement in all kinds of ways. Lately, it's been coding and studying for some tech-related certs, but it could be just communing with nature once in a while to clear away the junk in my brain for a few minutes or to visit a museum or two for some cultural enrichment. I'm an avid lifelong learner and will always be seeking the next opportunity to learn something new or improve myself in some way or another.

## Experience

As I mentioned above, I've been doing a lot of consulting work for the last couple of years. Since I have a hybrid business/tech background, I've been doing a little of both. Everything from helping small business owners to navigate some better ways to market their products all the way up to digging into the HTML of a few different websites and spinning up new SQL DBs to house client information.

I've worked for various different companies, everything from small little mom-and-pop shops with less than 20 people all the way up to global corporations like The Walt Disney Company and Blizzard Entertainment.

## Education

## Skills

When it comes to my skills, I'm fairly adept at a few things. For example, I've been the go-to IT person in my family since I was about 10 years old. My toy store in elementary school was more Fry's than F.A.O. Schwarz. And by the time I actually went to college to learn more about tech, I'd built a few dozen systems from scratch and had learned a thing or two about some basic HTML programming.

In terms of specifics...

### Computer Skills

- Highly Adept with Microsoft products including the Office Suite, Visual Studio, Visio, OneNote, Outlook, SharePoint, & Project
- Experience with Windows, Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian), & Mac OSX operating systems
- Over 3 years of experience with C, C#, & SQL programming
- Adept with IT support tools such as Wireshark, Remedy, and Atlassian JIRA

### Interpersonal Skills

- Excellent Oral & Written Communication Skills
- Strong Organizational Skills

## Honors & Achievements

Some things that I'm particularly proud of include:

- Promoted from Level 1 Technician to Supervisor in less than half the time of predecessors

That's basically me in a nutshell. As I mentioned before, I'll be continuously adding my offline projects to repos and linking them on this page so feel free to check back.
